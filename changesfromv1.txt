1. Using PCA of highly correlated features (r=0.8) clustered manually. The biclustering wasn't working well (unstable). Some PCA had low explained variance in the first component and didn't translate directly to the semantic meaning.
2. Grid search for the the regularization param of the causal model (using a weighted-auc score)
3. Estimating the placebo effect using 1000 bootstrap sample
4. Grid search for the the regularization param of the log regression propensity model for Overrule
5. Grid search for the the l of the KNN propensity model for Overrule and using a Calibrated knn
